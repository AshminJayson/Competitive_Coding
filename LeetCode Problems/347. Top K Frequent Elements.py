        #This would allow me to hold the counts of all elements in O(n)
        #However finding the top k would require a sort which takes a min tc of O(n log n) which would result in a TLE
        #Therefore I must either change the overall approach or think of finding a way to hold the order ðŸ¤”

        #Think ma bwoi think.

        #Lemme try breaking this into two parts : The counting is already done, now it's just items with a count and I have to find the 
        #k items with the highest count in O(n) tc

        #Approach 1 : Divide the total testcases as k < n and k = n
        #for k < n sorting can be done in O(k log k) which is < O(n log n) and if k = n return it as is.

        # if k == len(nums):
        #     return nums

        # sht = dict(sorted(ht.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True))

        #Sometimes I wonder why don't I just mess around and work out a solution cause this f*ing worked ðŸ¤£
        #Well everyday is a learning experience 


        #Approach 2 : Quickselect (Hoare's selection algorithm)

        #This has a pretty steep learning curve and so I'll probably settle for one question today
        #There ain't no point half assing this

        #This trench keeps getting deeper, now there's this dude called Lamuto and his paritioning scheme
        

        #Lomuto's Paritioning
        #Pick the last element as the pivot index
        #Set the first as the the store_index and if list[i>store_index] < list[pivot] swap list[i] and list[store_index] and increment store index
