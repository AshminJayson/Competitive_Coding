Problem Statement :
	
	Tony got into a fight with Chris and has challenged him to a numbers game.
	
	According to the game rules - 
	Tony gives Chris a number x.
	Among all possible positive integers N that has the sum of digits as x,  Chris has to consider the integer N+1, and find the minimum possible sum of digits that N+1 can have.
	
	For example, if x = 9, then N could be 9, 18, 27, 36, 711 ....  and so on. However, if Chris chooses N = 9, then sum of digits of N + 1 i.e. 10 will be 1, which is the minimum possible value of 
	digits that Chris can obtain via the above rule.

Input Format :
	First line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
	It is then followed by T lines containing the integer x for each case.

Output Format :
	Output the minimum possible value of N + 1 that Chris can obtain.

Constraints :
	1 <= T <= 1000
	1 <= x <= 10^5

Example :
	Input : 
	2
	5
	9
	
	Output : 
	6
	1
